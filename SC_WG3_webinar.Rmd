# Epidemiological and methodological considerations for the estimation of freedom from infection

---
## Freedom from infection as a statistical problem

- Evidence of infection sought by testing animals from the population of interest

--

 - Testing all the animals is usually too costly $\rightarrow$ sampling
 
--

 - $\geq 1$ (true) positive $\rightarrow$ infection is present
 
--

 - 0 test positive $\rightarrow$ infection is absent OR infection is present, but no infected included in the sample

--


- Most of the time, the problem consists in **quantifying the probability that the infection is not present given that it has not been detected**

--

- The question can be formulated as: 

 - **how sure are we that the infection is truly absent given that we did not find it?** or

 - **what is the probability of a false negative surveillance outcome?**

## Freedom from infection as a statistical problem

- Consider a large population in which 20% of animals are infected

- 10 animals of this population are tested with a perfect test

- Below is the distribution of the number of positives we would get if we could take many samples of 10 animals

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6}
limy <- c(0, .35)
x <- dbinom(0:10, 10, .2)
barplot(x, ylim = limy,
        names.arg = 0:10,
        xlab = "Number of test positives out of 10 animals tested", 
        cex.lab = 1.5)
```

## Freedom from infection as a statistical problem

- Consider a large population in which 1% of animals are infected

- 20 animals of this population are tested with a perfect test

- Below is the distribution of the number of positives we would get if we could take many samples of 20 animals

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 6}
x <- dbinom(0:10, 20, .01)
barplot(x,
        names.arg = 0:10,
        xlab = "Number of test positives out of 100 animals tested", 
        cex.lab = 1.5)
```

## Freedom from infection as a statistical problem

- When testing 10 animals in a population with a prevalence of infection of 20%, there is a 10.7% chance of getting no test positive

 - The probability of a false negative surveillance outcome is:

$$p(X = 0| n = 10, \pi = 0.2) = 0.107$$

--

- When testing 20 animals in a population with a prevalence of infection of 20%, the probability of a false negative surveillance outcome is:

$$p(X = 0| n = 20, \pi = 0.2) = 0.01$$

--

- When testing 20 animals in a population with a prevalence of infection of 1%, the probability of a false negative surveillance outcome is:

$$p(X = 0| n = 20, \pi = 0.01) = 0.818$$

--

- What happens if the prevalence is 0?

---
## Freedom from infection as a statistical problem

- Probability of a false negative surveillance outcome $\nearrow$ when:

 - sample size $\searrow$
 
 - prevalence $\searrow$
 
--

- But usually, the **true prevalence** is not known

 - We now how to estimate $p(X = 0|n, \pi)$
 
 - We would like to know $p(\pi = 0 | X = 0, n)$


---
## Freedom from infection as a statistical problem

- Chosen approach: use of a **design prevalence**

--

- Principle:

 - Assume that the disease is present at some chosen prevalence $\pi_t$, called the *design prevalence*
 
 - Make hypotheses that can be tested from this design prevalence

 $$H_o: \pi \geq \pi_t$$
 $$H_A: \pi < \pi_t$$
 
--
 
 - Construct confidence intervals, estimate probabilities of error from these hypotheses

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
magick::image_read_pdf("./tables/tab_error_1.pdf")
```

---
# What is a probability, **frequentist version**

- Probabilities as frequencies of events

--

- The probability of drawing an infected animal when randomly sampling from a large population is the infection prevalence
 
--

- When estimating prevalence by randomly sampling from a large population, the estimation will get closer to the true prevalence as sample size increases

---
# What is a probability, **Bayesian version**

- Probabilities as hypotheses derived from evidence, knowledge or belief

--

- The probability of foot and mouth disease being introduced in Sweden cannot be estimated from past occurrences

 - Plausible values for this probability of introduction could be proposed by considering all the possible routes of introduction and adding the probabilities of occurrence of each one
 
--

- Rare / emerging events have small probabilities of occurrence that prevent the estimation of frequencies 

--

$\Rightarrow$ In essence, quantifying a probability of freedom from infection from absence of evidence of presence can be seen as a Bayesian problem: how consistent are the data with the assumptions made?

---
# Output-based standards

- Objective of output-based surveillance: produce outputs that are independent of the input and method of analysis used

--

- What are these outputs?

 - (Specificity of surveillance)
 
 - Sensitivity of surveillance
 
 - Probability of freedom from infection
 
 - Expected cost of error
 
 - $\ldots$

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
magick::image_read_pdf("./tables/tab_error_2.pdf")
```

---
# Specificity of surveillance

- Probability of a negative surveillance outcome when the infection is absent (true negative):

 $$SSp = p(O^-|D^-)$$

 - Usually assumed to be 1 (i.e. no false positive) $\rightarrow$ every positive test will be investigated until either proven to be a false positive or confirmed as a true positive
 
```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
magick::image_read_pdf("./tables/tab_error_2.pdf")
```

---
# Sensitivity of surveillance

- Probability of a positive surveillance outcome when the infection is present (at the design prevalence)

 $$SSe = p(O^+|D^+)$$

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
magick::image_read_pdf("./tables/tab_error_2.pdf")
```

---
# Probability of freedom from infection

- Probability that the infection is absent when the outcome of surveillance is negative

  $$P_{free} = p(D^-|O^-)$$


```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
magick::image_read_pdf("./tables/tab_error_2.pdf")
```

- is in fact a negative predictive value

  $$P_{free} = \frac{SSp.(1 - \pi_t)}{SSp.(1 - \pi_t) + (1-SSe) . \pi_t}$$
  
---
# Probability of freedom from infection

- Probability that the infection is absent when the outcome of surveillance is negative

  $$P_{free} = p(D^-|O^-)$$


```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
magick::image_read_pdf("./tables/tab_error_3.pdf")
```

- since $SSp = 1$, can be written as:

  $$P_{free} = \frac{1 - \pi_t}{1-SSe.\pi_t}$$

---
# Expected cost of error

- Estimation of the cost of undetected infections

 $$ECE = (1 - P_{free}) . Cost_{error}$$
 
- Can be used to justify the total cost of surveillance

 $$TSC = Cost_{surveillance}+(1 - P_{free}).Cost_{error}$$

--
- Who is paying?

 - Cost for the seller or buyer?

 - Spread of infection, public health, lost markets $\ldots$


---
# Other outputs

- More recently, indicators of early detection considered, although not strictly related to infection freedom

 - Influence on the cost of error $\rightarrow$ the longer the time between introduction of infection, the higher the resulting costs

## Impact of disease prevalence context on surveillance objectives

1. Infection is absent from area (e.g. BVDV in Scandinavian countries)
 
 - **Objective of surveillance =** prove to trading partners that it is safe to trade with you
 
 - **Level at which proof of freedom is sought =** whole area
 
--

1. Infection is still present (e.g. BVDV in France)

 - **Objective of surveillance =** identify herds / regions that are safe to trade with
 
 - **Level at which proof of freedom is sought =** herd / region
