# Epidemiological and methodological considerations for the estimation of freedom from infection

---
## Freedom from infection as a statistical problem

- Evidence of infection sought by testing animals from the population of interest

--

 - Testing all the animals is usually too costly `\(\rightarrow\)` sampling
 
--

 - `\(\geq 1\)` (true) positive `\(\rightarrow\)` infection is present
 
--

 - 0 test positive `\(\rightarrow\)` infection is absent OR infection is present, but no infected included in the sample

--


- Most of the time, the problem consists in **quantifying the probability that the infection is not present given that it has not been detected**

--

- The question can be formulated as: 

 - **how sure are we that the infection is truly absent given that we did not find it?** or

 - **what is the probability of a false negative surveillance outcome?**

## Freedom from infection as a statistical problem

- Consider a large population in which 20% of animals are infected

- 10 animals of this population are tested with a perfect test

- Below is the distribution of the number of positives we would get if we could take many samples of 10 animals

- 20 animals of this population are tested with a perfect test

- Below is the distribution of the number of positives we would get if we could take many samples of 20 animals

---
## Freedom from infection as a statistical problem

- When testing 10 animals in a population with a prevalence of infection of 20%, there is a 10.7% chance of getting no test positive

 - The probability of a false negative surveillance outcome is:

`$$p(X = 0| n = 10, \pi = 0.2) = 0.107$$`

--

- When testing 20 animals in a population with a prevalence of infection of 20%, the probability of a false negative surveillance outcome is:

`$$p(X = 0| n = 20, \pi = 0.2) = 0.01$$`

--

- When testing 20 animals in a population with a prevalence of infection of 1%, the probability of a false negative surveillance outcome is:

`$$p(X = 0| n = 20, \pi = 0.01) = 0.818$$`

--

- What happens if the prevalence is 0?

---
## Freedom from infection as a statistical problem

- Probability of a false negative surveillance outcome `\(\nearrow\)` when:

 - sample size `\(\searrow\)`
 
 - prevalence `\(\searrow\)`
 
--

- But usually, the **true prevalence** is not known

 - We now how to estimate `\(p(X = 0|n, \pi)\)`
 
 - We would like to know `\(p(\pi = 0 | X = 0, n)\)`


---
## Freedom from infection as a statistical problem

- Chosen approach: use of a **design prevalence**

--

- Principle:

 - Assume that the disease is present at some chosen prevalence `\(\pi_t\)`, called the *design prevalence*
 
 - Make hypotheses that can be tested from this design prevalence

 `$$H_o: \pi \geq \pi_t$$`
 `$$H_A: \pi &lt; \pi_t$$`
 
--
 
 - Construct confidence intervals, estimate probabilities of error from these hypotheses

![](SC_WG3_webinar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# What is a probability, **frequentist version**

- Probabilities as frequencies of events

--

- The probability of drawing an infected animal when randomly sampling from a large population is the infection prevalence
 
--

- When estimating prevalence by randomly sampling from a large population, the estimation will get closer and closer to the true prevalence as sample size increases

---
# What is a probability, **Bayesian version**

- Probabilities as hypotheses derived from evidence, knowledge or belief

--

- The probability of foot and mouth disease being introduced in Sweden cannot be estimated from past occurrences

 - Plausible values for this probability of introduction could be proposed by considering all the possible routes of introduction and adding the probabilities of occurrence of each one
 
--

- Rare / emerging events have small probabilities of occurrence that prevent the estimation of frequencies 

---
# Output-based standards

- Objective of output-based surveillance: produce outputs that are independent of the input and method of analysis used

--

- What are these outputs?

 - (Specificity of surveillance)
 
 - Sensitivity of surveillance
 
 - Probability of freedom from infection
 
 - Expected cost of error
 
 - `\(\ldots\)`

--

![](SC_WG3_webinar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Specificity of surveillance

- Probability of a negative surveillance outcome when the infection is absent (true negative):

 `$$SSp = p(O^-|D^-)$$`

 - Usually assumed to be 1 (i.e. no false positive) `\(\rightarrow\)` every positive test will be investigated until either proven to be a false positive or confirmed as a true positive
 
![](SC_WG3_webinar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Sensitivity of surveillance

- Probability of a positive surveillance outcome when the infection is present (at the design prevalence)

 `$$SSe = p(O^+|D^+)$$`

![](SC_WG3_webinar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Probability of freedom from infection

- Probability that the infection is absent when the outcome of surveillance is negative

  `$$P_{free} = p(D^-|O^-)$$`


![](SC_WG3_webinar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

- is in fact a negative predictive value

  `$$P_{free} = \frac{SSp.(1 - \pi_t)}{SSp.(1 - \pi_t) + (1-SSe) . \pi_t}$$`
  
---
# Probability of freedom from infection

- Probability that the infection is absent when the outcome of surveillance is negative

  `$$P_{free} = p(D^-|O^-)$$`


![](SC_WG3_webinar_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

- since `\(SSp = 1\)`, can be written as:

  `$$P_{free} = \frac{1 - \pi_t}{1-SSe.\pi_t}$$`

---
# Expected cost of error

- Estimation of the cost of undetected infections

 `$$ECE = (1 - P_{free}) . Cost_{error}$$`
 
- Can be used to justify the total cost of surveillance

 `$$TSC = Cost_{surveillance}+(1 - P_{free}).Cost_{error}$$`

---
# Other outputs

- More recently, indicators of early detection considered, although not strictly related to infection freedom

 - Influence on the cost of error `\(\rightarrow\)` the longer the time between introduction of infection, the higher the resulting costs

## Impact of disease prevalence context on surveillance objectives

1. Infection is absent from area (e.g. BVDV in Scandinavian countries)
 
 - **Objective of surveillance =** prove to trading partners that it is safe to trade with you
 
 - **Level at which proof of freedom is sought =** whole area
 
--

1. Infection is still present (e.g. BVDV in France)

 - **Objective of surveillance =** identify herds / regions that are safe to trade with
 
 - **Level at which proof of freedom is sought =** herd / region
